# Hello
This's my small project. I was trying to use firebase, so I created a simple firebase chat.

### In this chat user can:
- Create, edit and remove chats
- Create invites for other users
- Delete and edit own messages

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/VadyChel/FirebaseChat.git
```

2. Move to chat directory
```
cd chat
```

3. Install dependecies and run project
```
npm i && npm run serve
```

...or build chat for production
```
npm run build
```

#### Woow! You finish installation proccess, so you can continue setting up

1. Open config file(`chat/config.js`) and change firebase parameters to yours
2. You also can change favicon(`chat/public/favicon.ico`) and default site pallete in top of main css file(`chat/src/assets/main.css`)

**P.S. How to create firebase app you can see in official [firebase site](https://firebase.google.com)**
